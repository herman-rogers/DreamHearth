-Cat

This is a cat I found at a shelter. I call him James! James is a good name for a cat, right?

-Door (Closed)

Oh no, the door is closed! It makes me feel alone...

-Diary

Dear Diary: Today I started school. Everything is new and strange. I don't think I'll make friends.

-Door (Open)

I feel more safe now the door's open. James can come in at night now.

-Hole in Wall (no cat)

I hope there aren't any mice hiding in the walls. Or rats. Rats are bigger and scarier.

-Hole in Wall (with cat)

I hope there aren't any mice or rats hiding in the walls, James might eat them!

-Lamp (Broken)

This is my favourite lamp! I really like it, even though it's broken...

-Lamp (Fixed)

My lamp's all fixed. Now I can see what's in my room at night!

-Parrot

It's a wooden parrot. Dad thought this would help me sleep, but it just stares at me all the time...

-Picture Frame (normal)

I don't like this picture. It reminds me of our trip to Alaska. It was sooo cold!

-Picture Frame (changed)

There. Now I don't have to worry about that picture any more.

-Poster

I don't like this poster at all. Clowns are terrifying!

-Radiator

This will keep me cosy for sure!

-Window (open)

I should probably close this now. At night it'll be too cold to get out of bed!

-Window (closed)

The room can get much warmer now, but what if monsters like it too?!?
