Dear Diary:

Today I started my first day of school. No-one talked to me. I'm worried they don't like me. But my parents tell me that I might feel differently if I get a good night's sleep in a warm bed. So I'll try that. I have trouble sleeping though, because I keep thinking monsters are out to get me. But they haven't got me yet. So good night, diary!

Dear Diary: 

Today I tried to talk to somebody in school. Their name was Amy. They didn't say anything back to me. I don't think they like me. What did I do? Maybe in the morning I will understand. Good night, diary.


Dear Diary:

There are a lot of bigger kids at school. They scare me. They have been at school for a lot longer than me, does that mean I'll get scarier? I don't want to go to school any more. Good night, diary...

Dear Diary:

Today someone told me about ghosts. I don't want to end up as a ghost! Amy still doesn't want to talk to me. I REALLY want to know what I did. I'm so worried! I don't think I'll sleep tonight, diary.

Final day (?):

Dear Diary:

Amy spoke to me today. She's very nice! I think Amy is very shy. She says she wanted to talk to me, but she was worried I wouldn't like her. It's funny, that's how I felt too! It's good to know that everyone else is just like me.

THE END.
